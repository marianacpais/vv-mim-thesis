# Visual Viper: A Portable Visualization Library for Streamlined Scientific Communication


## Overview
This repository contains the LaTeX source files for the Master's Thesis titled "Visual Viper: A Portable Visualization Library for Streamlined Scientific Communication". The thesis discusses the development and application of an automated Python library designed to streamline the process of creating data visualizations, specifically aimed at enhancing scientific communication in the healthcare sector.

## Abstract
### Background
The healthcare industry is undergoing a digital transformation that results in a rapidly growing amount of data. This change has led to a pressing need for efficient and automated data visualization tools.

### Aim
The study aims to detail the development of the Visual Viper library (VV), assess its performance, explore its adaptability and modular architecture, and evaluate its practical applications in healthcare research.

### Methods
VV is built using Python and employs Vega-Lite for high-level interactive graphics. Developed using object-oriented programming (OOP) and test-driven development (TDD) practices, the library operates in an environment-agnostic manner and offers serverless deployment options.

### Results
Performance metrics suggest that VV is significantly more efficient than manual methods in creating data visualizations.

### Conclusion
The VV library provides a robust, modular, and scalable solution for automating data visualizations in healthcare, thereby potentially enhancing scientific communication efficiency.
