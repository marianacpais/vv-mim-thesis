               popular textual notation to capture requirements in agile
               software development. [Question/Problem] To date there is no
               scientific evidence on the effectiveness of user stories. The
               goal of this paper is to explore how practicioners perceive this
               artifact in the context of requirements engineering. [Principal
               ideas/results] We explore perceived effectiveness of user
               stories by reporting on a survey with 182 responses from
               practitioners and 21 follow-up semi-structured interviews. The
               data shows that practitioners agree that using user stories, a
               user story template and quality guidelines such as the INVEST
               mnemonic improve their productivity and the quality of their
               work deliverables. [Contribution] By combining the survey data
               with 21 semi-structured follow-up interviews, we present 12
               findings on the usage and perception of user stories by
               practitioners that employ user stories in their everyday work

               books and on the Web. Most of these charts are only available as
               bitmap images; without access to the underlying data it is
               prohibitively difficult for viewers to create more effective
               visual representations. In response we present ReVision, a
               system that automatically redesigns visualizations to improve
               graphical perception. Given a bitmap image of a chart as input,
               ReVision applies computer vision and machine learning techniques
               to identify the chart type (e.g., pie chart, bar chart,
               scatterplot, etc.). It then extracts the graphical marks and
               infers the underlying data. Using a corpus of images drawn from
               the web, ReVision achieves image classification accuracy of 96\%
               across ten chart categories. It also accurately extracts marks
               from 79\% of bar charts and 62\% of pie charts, and from these
               charts it successfully extracts data from 71\% of bar charts and
               64\% of pie charts. ReVision then applies perceptually-based
               design principles to populate an interactive gallery of

               stories' popularity among practitioners and their simple yet

               reasoning based on natural language processing. In our research,
               we have found that circa 50\% of real-world user stories contain
               easily preventable errors that may endanger their potential. To
               alleviate this problem, we have created methods, theories and
               tools that support creating better user stories. This tutorial
               combines our previous work into a pipeline for working with user
               stories: (1) The basics of creating user stories, and their use

  abstract  = {This paper discusses modularization as a mechanism for improving
               the flexibility and comprehensibility of a system while allowing
               the shortening of its development time. The effectiveness of a
               ``modularization'' is dependent upon the criteria used in
               dividing the system into modules. A system design problem is
               presented and both a conventional and unconventional
               decomposition are described. It is shown that the unconventional
               decompositions have distinct advantages for the goals outlined.
               The criteria used in arriving at the decompositions are
               discussed. The unconventional decomposition, if implemented with
               the conventional assumption that a module consists of one or
               more subroutines, will be less efficient in most cases. An
               alternative approach to implementation which does not have this

              approach to visualization for the web. Rather than hide the
              underlying scenegraph within a toolkit-specific abstraction, D3
              enables direct inspection and manipulation of a native
              representation: the standard document object model (DOM). With
              D3, designers selectively bind input data to arbitrary document
              elements, applying dynamic transforms to both generate and modify
              content. We show how representational transparency improves
              expressiveness and better integrates with developer tools than
              prior approaches, while offering comparable notational efficiency
              and retaining powerful declarative components. Immediate
              evaluation of operators further simplifies debugging and allows

  abstract  = {Objectives: We evaluated the design of three novel visualization
               techniques for integrated health information with health care
               providers in older adult care. Through focus groups, we
               identified generalizable themes related to the visualization and
               interpretation of health information. Using these themes we
               address challenges with visualizing integrated health
               information and provide recommendations for designers. Methods:
               We recruited ten health care providers to participate in three
               focus groups. We applied a qualitative descriptive approach to
               code and extract themes related to the visualization of
               graphical displays. Results: We identified a set of four common
               themes across focus groups related to: 1) Trust in data for
               decision-making; 2) Per -ceived level of detail for
               visualization (sub-themes: holistic, individual components); 3)
               Cognitive issues (subthemes: training and experience; cognitive
               overload; contrast); and 4) Application of visual displays.
               Furthermore, recommendations are provided as part of the
               iterative design process for the visualizations. Conclusions:
               Data visualization of health information is an important
               component of care, impacting both the accuracy and speed of
               decision making. There are both functional and cognitive

               Driven Development (TDD) is developed and proposed to be applied
               in the software development process. TDD method requires
               developers to determine the business processes first and
               software design needed as test cases, then implement them by
               writing the code. One of the benefits of implementing TDD is the
               high code coverage value, that means all methods and
               functionalities will be tested. To measure the quality of the
               written code, code coverage can be used as a metric. The higher
               code coverage result, it indicates the better the quality of the
               application. This study aims to determine the impacts of
               applying the TDD method in the software development process to
               the code coverage results. To run our experiment, we use a case

               a systematic transformation between two distinct domain-specific
               languages. As a result, we obtain a general framework, which may
               inform the process of visualisation design, as well as enable
               the creation of flexible general-purpose systems for interactive
               visual analytics. Our efforts aim towards raising the level of
               abstraction, by allowing users to express queries through a
               vocabulary that is specific to their problem domain. This
               domain-specific language is based on the conceptual model of the
               input data. Subsequently, a visualisation specification
               prescribes a language transformation, which maps from the
               user-defined conceptual model to the application-defined
               graphics grammar. The key to this approach is a formal
               interpretation of the conceptual data model, using rich type
               information in order to capture the data semantics and
               structure. The theoretical foundations for this approach are
               introduced, building on existing theories from database, type
               system, and visualisation literature. Subsequently, we discuss
               the key concepts of the proposed framework. Finally, the
               applications of the framework are illustrated by three use
               cases, which successfully applied these concepts in real-world

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cardiovascular (CV) diseases show clear
               differences in clinical manifestation and treatment outcomes
               between men and women. To reduce sex disparities in achieving
               lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) goals, a sex-focused assessment is
               essential and more studies are needed to bring new evidence to
               clinicians. This study aims to assess the role of sex in
               attaining low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals,
               after correction for age, CV risk category, LLT intensity, and
               presence of mental health disorder and social deprivation.
               METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis of patients aged 40-85,
               followed in 1 hospital and 14 primary care centers in Portugal,
               using electronic health records from 1/1/2012 to 31/12/2020, was
               performed. The analysis considered an episode-based design,
               where exposure consists of any time when LLT was started or
               intensity changed. The likelihood of reaching the LDL-C goal
               according to contemporary ESC/EAS guidelines was modeled using
               multivariate Cox regression. LDL-C goal achievement at 180 days
               was defined as the outcome. The analysis was repeated at 30-day
               follow-up intervals up to 360 days, and also stratified by CV
               risk category. RESULTS: We identified 40,032 exposure episodes
               (LLT initiation or intensity change) in 30,323 distinct
               patients. Male sex, older age, lower CV risk and increasing LLT
               intensity were associated with improved LDL-C control. Women
               were 22\% less likely to reach the LDL-C goal than men (HR =
               0.78, 95\% CI:0.73, 0.82) independently of covariates.
               CONCLUSIONS: Women have a lower likelihood of attaining LDL-C
               goals than men after adjustment for LLT intensity, age, CV risk
               category, presence of mental health disorder and social
               deprivation. This finding underscores the need for further
               investigation and tailoring of LLT management strategies in
               women.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: As the amount of medical data in the electronic
              medical records system (EMR) is increasing tremendously, the
              required time to read it by health providers is growing by the
              exact proportionality. This means that physicians must increase
              the time spared for each patient again by the precise
              proportionality. This may lead to exposing the accuracy and
              quality of the course of action to be taken for the patients.
              Increasing the physician's required time for one patient means
              that the physician can see fewer patients. This will create an
              issue with the medical management authority as more physicians
              are needed, and higher expenses will be required. PURPOSE: The
              two questions that arise here are 1. Identify the potential
              opportunities and challenges for extensive data analysis in the
              healthcare sector. 2. Evaluate different ways in which big
              medical data can be analyzed? METHODS: The authors identified the
              four concerned parties representing the four potential solutions
              dimensions to answer these two questions. These parties are 1.
              physicians, 2. health information systems management (HISM)
              departments, mainly the EMR system, and 3. Health management
              departments 4. Relevant Health Information Systems (HIS) parties.
              A literature review and 25 interviews were conducted. The
              interviews covered 1: Two global organizations: John Hopkins and
              Joint Commission International (JCI), 2: Three United Arab
              Emirates-based health organizations: Department of health in Abu
              Dhabi, SEHA in Abu Dhabi, Dubai health Authority (DHA) in Dubai,
              3: 10 Physicians from different specialties, 4: Five EMR managers
              and 5: Five IT (Information Technology) professionals
              representing the HIS parties. Qualitative analysis is used as the
              approach for data analysis. RESULTS: Identifying the managerial
              and the technical recommendations to be utilized mainly based on
              digital disruption technologies, tools, and processes.
              CONCLUSION: Healthcare has been slow in embracing digital
              disruption and transformation. In most areas, it is still in the
              initial stages. Recommendations are based on the UAE cases,

  abstract  = {[The subject of graphical methods for data analysis and for data
               presentation needs a scientific foundation. In this article we
               take a few steps in the direction of establishing such a
               foundation. Our approach is based on graphical perception-the
               visual decoding of information encoded on graphs-and it includes
               both theory and experimentation to test the theory. The theory
               deals with a small but important piece of the whole process of
               graphical perception. The first part is an identification of a
               set of elementary perceptual tasks that are carried out when
               people extract quantitative information from graphs. The second
               part is an ordering of the tasks on the basis of how accurately
               people perform them. Elements of the theory are tested by
               experimentation in which subjects record their judgments of the
               quantitative information on graphs. The experiments validate
               these elements but also suggest that the set of elementary tasks
               should be expanded. The theory provides a guideline for graph
               construction: Graphs should employ elementary tasks as high in
               the ordering as possible. This principle is applied to a variety
               of graphs, including bar charts, divided bar charts, pie charts,
               and statistical maps with shading. The conclusion is that
               radical surgery on these popular graphs is needed, and as
               replacements we offer alternative graphical forms-dot charts,
               dot charts with grouping, and framed-rectangle charts.]},

  abstract  = {`Big data' is massive amounts of information that can work
               wonders. It has become a topic of special interest for the past
               two decades because of a great potential that is hidden in it.
               Various public and private sector industries generate, store,
               and analyze big data with an aim to improve the services they
               provide. In the healthcare industry, various sources for big
               data include hospital records, medical records of patients,
               results of medical examinations, and devices that are a part of
               internet of things. Biomedical research also generates a
               significant portion of big data relevant to public healthcare.
               This data requires proper management and analysis in order to
               derive meaningful information. Otherwise, seeking solution by
               analyzing big data quickly becomes comparable to finding a
               needle in the haystack. There are various challenges associated
               with each step of handling big data which can only be surpassed
               by using high-end computing solutions for big data analysis.
               That is why, to provide relevant solutions for improving public
               health, healthcare providers are required to be fully equipped
               with appropriate infrastructure to systematically generate and
               analyze big data. An efficient management, analysis, and
               interpretation of big data can change the game by opening new
               avenues for modern healthcare. That is exactly why various
               industries, including the healthcare industry, are taking
               vigorous steps to convert this potential into better services
               and financial advantages. With a strong integration of
               biomedical and healthcare data, modern healthcare organizations

              Scrum, XP, and Lean. This research paper surveys the impact of
              TDD on software development with a specific focus on its effects
              on code coverage, productivity, internal and external software
              quality, and the affective reactions associated with TDD. The
              paper also identifies potential challenges and drawbacks of
              implementing TDD, such as increased overhead and time
              consumption, a learning curve for developers, and difficulty in
              testing certain types of code. The studies' results suggest that
              TDD can improve code coverage, and code quality, reduce defects,
              increase productivity and developer satisfaction, improve
              internal and external software quality, and ultimately lead to
              higher customer satisfaction.},

  abstract  = {According to the extensive 50-year-old body of knowledge in
               object-oriented programming and design, good software designs
               are, among other characteristics, lowly coupled, highly
               cohesive, extensible, comprehensible, and not fragile. However,
               with the increased complexity and heterogeneity of contemporary
               software, this might not be enough. This paper discusses the
               practical challenges of object-oriented design in modern
               software development. We focus on three main challenges: (1) how
               technologies, frameworks, and architectures pressure developers
               to make design decisions that they would not take in an ideal
               scenario, (2) the complexity of current real-world problems
               require developers to devise not only a single, but several
               models for the same problem that live and interact together, and
               (3) how existing quality assessment techniques for
               object-oriented design should go beyond high-level metrics.
               Finally, we propose an agenda for future research that should be
               tackled by both scientists and practitioners soon. This paper is
               a call for arms for more reality-oriented research on the
               object-oriented software design field.},
